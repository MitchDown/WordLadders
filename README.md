Word Ladders

This python program was created for an assignment for a Languages and Computations course. It is designed to take in a
dictionary file, 'dictionary.txt', and a desired pairs file, 'pairs.txt'. The dictionary file contains one word per line.
The pairs file contains two words per line, seperated by a space, that you want the program to find a word ladder between.

The program reads in the dictionary and pair files, and works to identify word ladders between the pairs provided, that is, 
find a list of words with only 1 character difference from the dictionary file.

Run this program with 'python3 wordLadder.py'
